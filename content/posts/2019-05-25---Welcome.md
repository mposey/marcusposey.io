Hi, welcome to my blog! For a short bio of who I am, check out the [about page](/pages/about/).

I started this blog for two reasons. First to practice writing: thinking well and communicating clearly have been two of my biggest personal goals. Second to have a better way to share my thoughts and projects. I don't necessarily want to create a popular blog, but at least want a way to more easily share my work to friends or to communities that might benefit.

I haven't decided exactly what to put on this blog yet. I've been working on some Machine Learning tutorials and writing about a fun project I worked on recently. I also might write about VR/metaverse, given how excited I've been about it, but other than that, I'm going to figure it out as I go!
