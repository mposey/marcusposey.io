Hi! My name is Marcus, and Iâ€™m an incoming freshmen at Cornell University studying computer science.

On this blog you'll see occasional musings, both  serious and silly, on web development, machine learning, startups, and whatever else comes to mind.

Feel free to reach out to me at [**mep296@cornell.edu**](mailto:mep296@cornell.edu)!
